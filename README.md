# WTC_Survey
A simple survey to gain insights on the genereal sentiments of students at WeThinkCode_ amidst
placement season.

## GOAL
The aim is conduct analysis on how ready they are, where they would like to work, 
do they find the course valuable, etc. I wanted to explore the process of data collection in a real life setting and apply my knowledge of data manipulation to try and draw indights as to how students are feeling and what they are thinking heading into the real world of software development.

## TOOLS
Form built with basic HTML and CSS
